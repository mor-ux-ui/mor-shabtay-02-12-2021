The task was to create an app for managing tracking of products purchased online, Upon request I built two routers one for displaying products shipped there you can assemble products and add new products, and the other for displaying the stores and the price amount of all the products.

The project is divided into two parts and managed through REDUX. And the calls to the servers are made by CUSTOM HOOK who uses AXIOS for requests from the server. The app is designed to be responsive to all types of screens.
